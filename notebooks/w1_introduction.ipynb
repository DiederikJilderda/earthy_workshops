    "Python Notebooks or Jupyter Notebooks are interactive environments for python scripting. In this course, the majority of programming workshops are based on python notebooks as they provide a low threshold environment for starters. Python notebooks can be executed with many interfaces such as [Jupyter Clients](https://docs.anaconda.com/ae-notebooks/4.3.1/user-guide/basic-tasks/apps/jupyter/) or [VS Code Integrated Notebooks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) . There is no fundamental difference in execution of the code between these interfaces, the only difference is the user experience. Thus, feel free to choose the one that suits your taste. We suggest to use the vs code interface as it will make it easier to navigate the files and interact with version control system.\n",
